    title: Medical Reviews
    body: Explore the findings from the California Independent Medical Review Dataset under Cardiac/circulatory.
    description: |
      This data is from the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC). It contains all decisions from Independent Medical Reviews (IMR) administered by the DMHC since January 1, 2001.
      An IMR is an independent review of a denied, delayed, or modified health care service that the health plan has determined to be not medically necessary, experimental/investigational or non-emergent/urgent.
      If the IMR is decided in an enrollee's favor, the health plan must authorize the service or treatment requested.

      Download the data from [California Independent Medical Review Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/ca-independent-medical-review).

      Here, we categorize the findings from the reviews under the Cardiac/Circulatory category.
